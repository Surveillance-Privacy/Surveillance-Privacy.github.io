					<p>Plagiarism is defined as "the act or an instance of the use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author without authorization and presenting the work of the author as his”. Turnitin is the most famous tool used to detect plagiarism. But, it have drastic implications on surveillance and privacy. Turnitin acknowledges that the submitted personal information may be shared, particularly IP addresses, device IDs or other online identifiers with third parties, including social and advertising networks. Student submissions are a kind of personal data which means online learning platforms that employ turnitin for plagiarism prevention are putting student privacy at risk by submitting their work to a database without student consent (reference). A student’s particular writing style, for example, can be used to personally identify an individual. Also, many times students include Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like student ID, email, etc. in their submissions which could make the task of identifying them easy and straightforward. Considering these problems, we have proposed a solution as shown above which involves a person(called anonymizer) who will modify student post before submitting it to Turnitin.</p>
					<p>Our proposed method consists of the following steps:
						<ol>
							<li>Publishing the post : When a student writes and submits a post, it will be directly published on the platform. There are 2 reasons to do it this way. The first one is crowdsourcing which involves participation of other students/teachers using the platform who can flag the post as plagiarised. The second reason is that anonymizer may take some time to modify the post and check it with Turnitin for any copied content.</li>
							<li>Anonymizer : After the publishing the post, it will be check a human(called anonymizer) who will modify it appropriately to make sure that student’s PII is not exposed. It involves 2 things. Firstly, he will remove all the student identifiers from the post. Secondly, he will divide the entire post into different sections containing 2-3 sentences. In this way, plagiarism can also be checked and it is difficult for Turnitin to combine all the submissions which belong to a single student based on his writing style. To take it to the next level, a single administrator account can be given this task to submit all the submissions on students behalf. As such, student privacy will not be at risk.</li>
							<li>Keep/remove the post : After checking it with Turnitin, anonymizer can remove the post from the platform if it is found to be plagiarised. Otherwise, it is kept on the platform.</li>
						</ol>
