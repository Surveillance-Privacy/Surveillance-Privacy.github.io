						<p>It is important to have plagiarism surveillance for an online education platform where there is student generated content. Many online platforms use third-party tools to detect plagiarism. However, these tools can have drastic implications on privacy and surveillance. These tools can collect various personal user information (e.g., IP addresses, device IDs, other online identifiers) that could be used for student profiling and advertising purposes. This clearly puts the students' privacy at risk. Students may share assignment submissions which they would not expect to be stored on third party servers indefinitely. Users' solutions or other student generated content's writing style can even be used to identify an individual and may explicitly disclose personal information. Lastly, it is important to note that other platforms may follow different privacy regulations due to local jurisdiction and their own company policies.</p>

							<h2><a href="generic.html">Proposed Solution for Catching Phishing</a></h2>
							<p class="info">Why should privacy and surveillance be considered when dealing with phishing?</p>
						</header>
						<p>Phishing is a type of spam that can occur in emails or in any platform that allows user generated content. In its earliest forms, spam was limited to emails, but over the years it has evolved. Now, we can see spammers frequently target social media sites and other platforms that have user generated content.  Phishing is very detrimental for a platform’s reputation and puts user privacy at risk. Therefore, it becomes important to monitor user content for such attacks.</p>
						<p>When selecting a phishing detection and removal solution for your platform, it is important to notice what the service's privacy policies include. Some plug ins have been known to store, share, and sell the following list of user data: user names, email addresss, the linked URL (for phishing detection purposes), users' content, users' personally identifiable information (PII)such as include online identifiers, internet or other network or device activity, such as cookie information, device identifiers, IP address, and geolocation data. This data can be used by third parties to infer a user’s behavior, routine, interests and maybe even their income.</p>

							<h2><a href="generic.html">Proposed Solution for Handling Illegal and Inappropriate User Generated Content</a></h2>
							<p class="info">Why should privacy and surveillance be considered when dealing with illegal and inappropraite content?</p>
						</header>
						<p>In an online learning environment, user generated content that contains sexual content, hate speech, abusive language, or that promotes harassment, violence or bullying will need to be removed from the platform. It is important to note that illegal content is subject to different legislative requirements depending on your location. Therefore user generated content surveillance for illegal content becomes an important consideration.</p>
						<p>There are several content moderation solutions that could be applied to an online learning environment to moderate student content, with varying implications on student privacy. <b>Pre-moderation</b> checks content before it is published online. Automatic detection methods, such as keyword detection, are typically used for pre-moderation with minimal human input, as using human moderators for pre-moderation causes delays in posting content, which is not ideal for online platforms. Another method to handle inappropriate content is <b>post-moderation</b>, where a content is moderated after it is published. Post-moderation can be completed using a variety of approaches. A platform can choose to depend entirely on human moderation, automatic methods can be employed, or there may be a combination of these two approaches in post-moderation.</p>
						<p>Whether human moderators or third part tools are used for pre- and/or post-moderation, it is important to note that the users' data will be shared with them and their privacy policies should be reviewed.</p>
