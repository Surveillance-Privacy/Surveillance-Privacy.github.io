					<p>In an online learning environment, posted UGC that contains sexual content, hate speech, abusive language, or that promotes harassment, violence or bullying will need to be removed from the platform.</p>
					<p>As there are many privacy implications when using third-party tools and services for addressing illegal/inappropriate content, we propose a technique which would avoid the use of these tools. Our technique uses a combination of post-moderation and reactive moderation for addressing inappropriate/illegal content without endangering studentsâ€™ privacy. Two local databases are required, one for storing all the user generated content and another for storing flagged posts. Both of the local databases will be managed by the platform and will be located in Canada itself, therefore reducing the risks to student privacy. Our proposed method consists of the following steps:
						<ol>
							<li>Algorithm: The first step in our method is to use an algorithm to flag posts which are illegal or inappropriate. The algorithm can be a simple filtering algorithm which performs checks based on a blacklisted set of words, or a sophisticated machine learning algorithm using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and attention based techniques, depending on the technical feasibility. The flagged content will be stored in the local database for illegal/inappropriate posts.</li>
							<li>Community: In addition to using an algorithm, our approach also incorporates community moderation with the help of a flagging or voting system. Users can flag any content that they find inappropriate or illegal. The platform can provide a drop-down menu to select the reason for inappropriate (ex. sexual content, hate speech, harassment, violence, abusive language, bullying, etc.). If the number of flags on a post exceeds a predetermined threshold, content will be filtered and stored in the local database for illegal/inappropriate content.</li>
							<li>Human Moderator: A human content moderator will be responsible for reviewing the content flagged by the algorithm as well as the users. Using algorithms and the community to flag content would reduce the load on a content moderator. The moderator will check the flagged content stored in the local database and will remove the content which is actually illegal or inappropriate. The moderator then taken appropriate action against the user as per the platform policy.</li>
